## Features

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- Cleaning and standardizing review text:
  - Removal of punctuation and special characters.
  - Lowercasing and tokenization.
  - Spelling correction using `TextBlob` and custom rules.
- Translation of missing English reviews from French using `TextBlob`.
- Generated additional features:
  - Review length.
  - Sentiment score (polarity).
- Dataset preparation for supervised tasks:
  - Star rating classification (1-5 stars).
  - Sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, negative).

### 2. **Supervised Learning**
- **Star Rating Prediction**:
  - Used a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on `TF-IDF` features.
  - Predicted ratings based on review content.
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Classifies reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
  - Random Forest trained with labeled data for accuracy.

### 3. **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Topic Modeling**:
  - Implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic extraction.
  - Visualized topics using `pyLDAvis`.

### 4. **Embedding and Similarity**
- Trained **Word2Vec** embeddings to find semantically similar words.
- Performed semantic search using cosine similarity.

### 5. **Explainable AI**
- **SHAP**:
  - Explained Random Forest predictions with SHAP values.
  - Displayed key features influencing predictions.

### 6. **Interactive Streamlit Application**
- **Key Functionalities**:
  - **Rating Prediction**:
    - Predict the number of stars (1-5) for user-entered reviews.
  - **Sentiment Prediction**:
    - Determine if the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.
  - **Summarization**:
    - Generate summaries for user reviews using pre-trained models.
  - **Explain Predictions**:
    - Visualize features influencing star rating predictions.
  - **RAG-Based Summary**:
    - Retrieve and summarize similar reviews for a given input.
  - **Question Answering**:
    - Answer dataset-related questions using a QA pipeline.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Topic distributions and SHAP explanations.
